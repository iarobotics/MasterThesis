\noindent The main scope of this project is to design and implement centralized control strategy for a swarm of nano-quadrotors. The main goals are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop the equations of motion (EOM) of the nano-quadrotor
    \item Model and simulate the EOM and network loss of information
    \item Implement a position controller
\end{itemize}
