This paper investigates the network effects on controlling a swarm of drones distributed over a wireless network that can have delays and packet loss. It is a centralised swarm of drones where the positional controller is offboard. The drone is mathematically modelled where the six linearized equations of motion are presented. These equations help simulate Crazyflie's internal attitude controller as well as the position controller. A network loop is added to the positional controller which models the network communication between the Crazyflie and the ground station. It is of interest to simulate the radio connection between the drone the ground station. The network effects are created by network delay and packet loss. The network model is simulated by using the TrueTime Matlab toolbox. Simulation and experiments ran generated over 2000 samples which helped graph a controller stability curve. The area under the curve indicates a stable system at 0.23 seconds of network delay and 0.03 packet loss for the simulations and a 0.25 seconds of delay and 0.3 packet loss for the experiments. As it is usual to assume a fast and reliable network, these results come in the support of designing controllers that can handle disturbances from the network.
